# Password Generator
This is the third homework assignment from the MSU Coding Boot Camp. The assignment was to modify the provided starter code to create a fully functional application that would allow users to generate random passwords based on password length, character and types.

## Prologue
This homework assignment was incredibly challenging for me. My very rudimentary understanding of Java Script and all of its complexities was a huge factor. Despite this, I did create a functional application. If I had had all of the time in the world, I think I could've figured it out on my own and maybe I'd feel more satisfied with the finished product. However, time was not on my side, so I took a more collaborative approach. I worked with a tutor, my fellow classmates, my loved ones (who have some coding experience) and of course, the wonders of the internet to help put this all together. In the span of a week the code has had many forms and states of being. Admittedly only in the last few hours have I actually found an understanding of how my own code actually works and have reconfigured it to function better!

## Chapter 1: And so it began...
Initially I really didn't know what I was looking at with the starter code and reconfigured the event listener based on a setup that I had found on Stack Overflow. It was entirely too complicated than it needed to be and didn't work with my other confirm pop ups that I needed. This is a theme in my coding journey - I'm always making things more complicated. Once I realized this, I scrapped that version built from the starter code.

## Chapter 2: Feeling good...
Setting up the variables, arrays, the confirm/prompt messages and the validation code went smoothly. I did have a leg up with the help of a tutor and one of the TA's pointing me in the right direction.

## Chapter 3: Now what...
At this point I knew what I needed to do, but couldn't translate that from words in my brain to functional code. I began by searching online and sifting through classroom activities. Inevitably I reached out to my fellow classmates and began crowd sourcing ideas. 

I knew that I needed to write code to...
* bring my arrays together
* use Math.random to pull characters at random
* create an equation that actually spit the password out
* prepare for debugging

## Chapter 4: We're not done here...
A couple of good-intentioned people spoon-fed me some code that DID work. Later we spent time discussing that code and why/how it worked. However, it wasn't working 100% how I had hoped it would, and I didn't truly understand it. I spent a lot of time trying to unravel that code in hopes that I could understand why it worked and how to improve it. Tbh, I nearly started over completely and wanted to give up! After conferring with other classmates - through their helpful hits, and willingness to share - I was able to reconfigure my code so that it works better than before! Even though the application was technically "done", I sat down with a loved one and we dissected the small sections of my code that were still fuzzy for me. I'm proud to say that this assignment has helped me gain a better understanding of for loops!

## Chapter 5: The end is only the beginning...
This assignment was technically challenging and emotionally draining (because I get in my own way). Feeling that imposter syndrome and trying very hard not to just give up took up far too much of my time and energy. I'm hoping that this will be the beginning of me finding better ways to navigate moments of frustration. Restructuring my study habits and project planning techniques will be key. There's not much time, and still so much to learn.
